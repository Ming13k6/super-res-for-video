# ESPCN Video Super Resolution

A lightweight deep learning project for enhancing low-resolution videos using ESPCN (Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network) with PyTorch and OpenCV.

The system extracts video frames, upscales them using a trained ESPCN model, then reconstructs them back into an enhanced video.

---

# Features

* ESPCN implementation using PyTorch
* CUDA GPU acceleration
* Video frame extraction + reconstruction
* Bicubic vs ESPCN comparison
* PSNR / SSIM evaluation
* Data augmentation during training
* Modular and reproducible pipeline

# Installation

## Clone repository

```bash id="clonefinal"
git clone <repository-url>
cd super-res-for-video
```

---

## Create virtual environment

### Windows

```bash id="venvfinal"
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux / MacOS

```bash id="venvlinuxfinal"
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Install dependencies

```bash id="installfinal"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Training

You may opt to use our trained model or train the model yourself with our preset settings and dataset

Place high-resolution images inside:

```bash id="datasetfinal"
dataset/hr/
```

Run training:

```bash id="trainfinal"
python train.py
```

Current training setup:

| Parameter     | Value    |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Epochs        | 200      |
| Batch Size    | 16       |
| Optimizer     | Adam     |
| Loss Function | MSE Loss |
| Scale Factor  | 4×       |

The trained model will be saved as:

```bash id="modelsavefinal"
espcn.pth
```

# Running Video Super Resolution

Make sure you are on the correct direction to the folder: ...\super-res-for-video

Run virtual environment (ignore this if you already activated)
### Windows

```bash id="venvfinal"
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux / MacOS

```bash id="venvlinuxfinal"
source venv/bin/activate
```
Then run
```
python app.py
```

After running the command, open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:7860
Then, upload your video and click the "submit" button. Click on the scissors button on the top right corner to trim the video however you want. Click on the "X" button next to it to abort the uploaded video. Once you are ready, click the submit button. The inference duration may varies from 100s to 500s+ depends on your PC specs, the video duration and whether you are using CPU or GPU, and the output should be an enhanced video and a comparison video that puts the enhanced one side-by-side with bicubic.

# Evaluation

Current results:

| Metric | Value  |
| ------ | ------ |
| PSNR   | ~37.88 |
| SSIM   | ~0.989 |

Observations:

* ESPCN produces sharper edges than Bicubic interpolation
* Improvements are more noticeable when zoomed in
* CUDA significantly improves inference speed

---

# GPU Support

The project automatically uses CUDA if available.

Check CUDA:

```bash id="checkcudafinal"
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

Tested on:

* NVIDIA RTX 3060

---

# Common Issues

## OpenCV missing

```bash id="opencverrorfinal"
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'
```

Fix:

```bash id="opencvfixfinal"
pip install opencv-python
```

---

## Black output video

Usually caused by:

* Corrupted frames
* Codec mismatch
* Invalid frame sizes

Fix:

* Delete generated frames
* Re-run inference
* Reconstruct video again

## Slow inference speed

CPU inference can be very slow for longer videos.

Recommended:

* Use CUDA GPU acceleration
* Reduce video resolution
* Use shorter test videos during development

# Future Improvements

* ESRGAN implementation
* Temporal consistency between frames
* Real-time webcam super resolution
* GUI/Desktop application
* Larger training dataset
* Better perceptual loss functions
